# Bootstrapped Devise Forms

To customize how Devise sign-up, edit profile, and sign-in forms look, you run the command

    rails generate devise views

which creates a folder in `app/views` called `devise` and extracts all the view templates that Devise uses out of the gem in to it. That way you can customize them to your heart's content.

However, I have prepared simple, Bootstrapped templates for each; feel free to steal them.
